  <!-- Description & Motivation requirement -->
  <section>
    <h2>Description and Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      CanvasTracker is a web-based academic planning tool designed to reduce the friction
      students experience when using the standard Canvas interface. Instead of forcing
      users to click through multiple pages for assignments, quizzes, and announcements,
      CanvasTracker consolidates everything into a single dashboard with multiple views.
      The goal is to help students feel more in control of their workload, minimize
      missed deadlines, and streamline daily planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the default Canvas experience, critical information is scattered across
      courses, assignment pages, calendars, and announcement feeds. Students must
      constantly jump between menus to piece together what is due and when. This
      fragmentation increases cognitive load and makes it easy to overlook tasks,
      especially when juggling multiple courses and deadlines. Our group set out to
      explore how an integrated Canvas-aware planner could improve usability,
      efficiency, and perceived control compared to existing Canvas tools and
      third-party apps.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Goals and Design Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The main goal was to design and evaluate an integrated Canvas dashboard that
      consolidates all assignments and deadlines into one interface with multiple views.
      The interface needed to be quick to scan, simple to interact with, and flexible
      enough to support different planning styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a system level, CanvasTracker was designed to provide a centralized, low-navigation
      view of all upcoming assignments and deadlines, reliably synchronize with Canvas so
      newly released tasks appear without manual copying, allow users to add personal tasks
      or reminders that sit alongside Canvas items, visually indicate urgency and status
      with color-coding and progress-like cues, and provide direct hyperlinks from each task
      back to its original Canvas page.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>
      The interface is built around a unified dashboard that can be viewed either as a
      calendar or as a list. In both modes, tasks are easy to find, filter, and manage
      without navigating away from the main page. Users can add tasks, set due dates,
      enable reminders, and mark items as complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Color and layout are used to communicate urgency and category. Tasks are grouped
      by due date, and the calendar view supports expanding a specific day to see all
      details at once. Direct links jump users into the corresponding Canvas assignment
      page when they are ready to submit or view more details, reducing the number of
      clicks required to get from planning to action.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <p>
      The project uses a lightweight but flexible stack centered around web standards
      and the Canvas LMS API. The front end is implemented with HTML5, CSS3, and
      vanilla JavaScript to keep interactions responsive and easy to maintain. Task
      lists and calendar views are rendered in the browser, emphasizing clarity and
      responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      CanvasTracker communicates with Canvas through a custom API proxy built with a
      Cloudflare Worker. This layer handles authentication and API requests while
      shielding client-side code from exposing sensitive tokens. Python scripts were
      used during development for data analysis and preprocessing tasks related to
      user feedback and app review text mining.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Online Study requirement -->
  <section>
    <h2>Online Study: App Review Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      During the early research phase, thousands of user reviews from various 
      academic planning and scheduling apps were collected and analyzed. 
      Word clouds helped reveal the most frequently used terms, highlighting 
      recurring concerns and feature requests from real users. These insights 
      guided the design priorities of CanvasTracker and grounded the project in
      real-world expectations for scheduling tools.

  <!-- Prototyping Phase requirement: summary + detailed iterations -->
  <section>
    <h2>Prototyping Phase</h2>
    <p>
      The prototyping phase moved from hand-drawn sketches to interactive digital
      interfaces. Iteration 1 focused on quick wireframes to explore layout ideas,
      Iteration 2 translated those sketches into working low- and mid-fidelity
      prototypes, and Iteration 3 refined the interface into the final high-fidelity
      design used in the user studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each iteration was evaluated with users, and their feedback shaped how tasks
      were displayed, how synchronization behaved, and how much control students
      felt over their schedule.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Iteration 1: Early Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
      The first iteration focused on sketching out basic layouts for the task manager 
      and calendar dashboard. These hand-drawn wireframes explored how users might add 
      tasks, view upcoming deadlines, and interact with a simplified version of the 
      CanvasTracker interface before moving into digital prototyping.
    </p>

    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Iteration 2: Digital Prototypes</h2>
    <p>
      Building on the hand-drawn wireframes from Iteration 1, the next phase involved
      developing early digital versions of the CanvasTracker interface. These prototypes
      began shaping the layout, interaction flow, and visual hierarchy while still
      maintaining a lightweight structure suitable for rapid iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first prototype introduced a very simple interface for adding tasks, syncing
      with Canvas, and showing due dates. The second prototype refined typography,
      spacing, interaction controls, and began exploring dark mode and filtering logic.
    </p>

    <div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:20px; margin-top:18px;">

      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Iteration 3: Final Version</h2>
    <p>
      The final iteration of CanvasTracker represents a fully refined interface based on 
      insights gathered from user testing, workload assessments, and structured evaluation 
      of earlier prototypes. This version features a polished dark-mode layout, clearer task 
      organization, improved spacing, and streamlined interactions for syncing Canvas 
      assignments and filtering upcoming tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      By incorporating consistent feedback across multiple rounds of usability testing, 
      the design balances readability, efficiency, and visual clarity, delivering a clean, 
      modern task management environment that aligns with students’ real needs.

  <!-- User Study 1 requirement -->
  <section>
    <h2>User Study 1: Interface Evaluation Results</h2>
    <p>
      After creating early interactive prototypes for both the Calendar View and 
      the List View, users were asked to evaluate each layout based on clarity, 
      usability, and overall intuitiveness. Participants rated statements on a 
      five-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The study provided insight into which layout communicated information more 
      effectively and which interaction patterns felt easiest for users.

    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- User Study 2 requirement -->
  <section>
    <h2>User Study 2: Workload and Usability Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      To better understand how users experienced CanvasTracker during hands-on testing, 
      participants completed a NASA Task Load Index assessment and a short usability
      questionnaire. These evaluations measured perceived mental demand, effort,
      frustration, and overall interaction satisfaction.
    </p>

    <div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:20px; margin-top:18px;">
      <div style="flex:1; min-width:300px;">

             style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; border:1px solid #ddd;" />
        <p class="small">
          NASA TLX results indicate low mental demand, low effort, and very low frustration 
          when using the system, suggesting that the planner was intuitive and low-stress 
          to interact with.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style="flex:1; min-width:300px;">

             style="width:100%; border-radius:10px; border:1px solid #ddd;" />
        <p class="small">
          Usability feedback shows high agreement that the system was easy to use, well 
          organized, and made it easy to find assignments. Users also reported feeling 
          in control and expressed interest in regular use if integrated with Canvas.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Iterations and Overall Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Across all iterations, users consistently described the interface as clean and
      simple, with task creation and the calendar day-expansion feature standing out
      as particularly useful. Feedback guided improvements such as clearer controls for
      deleting, editing, or reordering tasks, avoiding duplicates when syncing, showing
      more tasks per calendar view, and adding options for hiding completed or distant
      tasks. Suggestions such as class-based color coding and optional time fields for
      deadlines informed future design directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usability metrics and NASA-TLX workload scores indicated low mental demand and
      low frustration. Participants reported that CanvasTracker felt intuitive, well
      organized, and effective for managing a busy schedule. Many preferred it over
      the native Canvas interface for daily assignment management and filtering, while
      still relying on Canvas for announcements.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Outcome and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      The final prototypes demonstrate that an integrated, Canvas-aware planner can
      meaningfully reduce the friction of staying on top of coursework. By simplifying
      navigation, presenting all tasks in one place, and supporting both Canvas and
      personal items, CanvasTracker helps students feel more organized and in control
      of their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future directions include deeper calendar integration, richer color-coding and
      tagging options, improved task history views, and additional accessibility
      refinements. With native Canvas integration, CanvasTracker or a similar tool
